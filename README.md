### Final project of the fullstack bootcamp of GeeksHubs
This project has been set with a deadline of 15 days. To fulfil this project it was necessary to create an application with an API and a front-end module. The front-end module is made with Reactjs and the API is made with Nodejs, Expressjs and MongoDB so the full project follows the MERN stack.
